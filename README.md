# International-Telecommunication-Union-Cyber-Drill-Penetration-Testing-Tool
This repository contains the official Cyber Drill Penetration Testing Toolkit developed for international cyber capacity-building exercises led by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). 

 Designed to simulate real-world cyber attack scenarios, this toolkit enables national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), Critical Infrastructure Operators, and other stakeholders to assess, test, and improve their incident response and system defense capabilities.

The toolkit provides a comprehensive suite of modular, customizable penetration testing tools to evaluate the security posture of various systems and networks. It includes scripts, payloads, emulated threat scenarios, vulnerability scanners, phishing simulators, and red team/blue team utilities aligned with global cyber norms and ethical testing standards.

Used in official ITU-led cyber drills and regional simulations, the toolkit empowers member states and organizations to conduct hands-on technical exercises in a controlled, legal environment. It supports testing across multiple layers, including web applications, APIs, email gateways, cloud infrastructure, and IoT systems.

The repository is intended for use by trained cybersecurity professionals and is accompanied by detailed documentation, usage policies, and safety guidelines to ensure responsible deployment. Together, these tools help promote international cooperation, build cyber resilience, and enhance national cybersecurity readiness.
